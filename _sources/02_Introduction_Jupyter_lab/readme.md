# Introduction to Jupyter Lab
In this chapter we will introduce [Jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org) an interactive environment for developing Python code in notebooks. 
The slides are available [online](https://github.com/BiAPoL/HIP_Introduction_to_Napari_and_image_processing_with_Python_2022/blob/main/docs/02_Introduction_Jupyter_lab/Introduction_Jupyter_lab.pdf). 
Afterwards, will immediately write our own notebooks and learn how to use them properly avoiding common pitfalls.
