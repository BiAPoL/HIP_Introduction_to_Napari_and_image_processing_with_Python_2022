# Feature extraction
In this chapter we will derive quantitative measurements from labeled images, we will _extract features_. We will do this with two open-source libraries: [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) and [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/). For the second, we will use the napari plugin [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-simpleitk-image-processing) which is available from python Jupyter notebooks in a convenient way.

The slides are available [online](https://github.com/BiAPoL/HIP_Introduction_to_Napari_and_image_processing_with_Python_2022/blob/main/docs/08_Feature_extraction/Feature_extraction_and_processing_tables.pdf).
