# Image analysis with Python and Napari
In this Jupyter book we will introduce you to the basics of image processing [Python](https://python.org/) and [Napari](https://napari.org/). The one-day course is focused on processing microscopy images showing cells and nuclei. We will dive through segmenting objects, measuring their properties, managing measurements in tables and plotting results.
