# Image segmentation
In this chapter we will dive into image segmentation. We will binarize images, label objects in images, and we will post-process binary images and label images. The goal is to learn how to differentiate cells and nuclei from the image background as well as how to modify those segmentations to better represent of what we think the segmentation should look like.
